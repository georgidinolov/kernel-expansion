\begin{acknowledgements}
  I want to thank my advisors, Professor Abel Rodr\'iguez and
  Professor Hongyun Wang, for helping and mentoring me through the
  process of completing this work. Thank you both for your unyielding
  patience and never losing faith in my work. I have learned
  tremendously, and I cannot have done this without you both guiding
  me at every step. I also want to thank both Professor Raquel Prado
  and Professor Athanasios Kottas for advising me during my first as a
  statistics graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, and Professor Prado in
  particular for serving on my dissertation committee.

  I want to thank my wife, Alison, for always supporting me and
  reminding me of the light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you also
  to the rest of my family for your encouragement and love.
