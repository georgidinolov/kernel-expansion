    \textcolor{red}{DONE}

\item Equations and text from line 6 of page 5 to the end of section 2, change to \\
$$p_{FD}(\left. x, y, t \right| b) = p(\left. x, y, t \right| b) 
+ h^2 \mbox{F}_{reg}(b) + h^2 \mbox{F}_{irreg}(b) + 
\varepsilon_{mach} \mbox{F}_{round}(b) $$
where we have included parameter $b $ explicitly as a simplified notation for 
$[a_x, b_x]$ and $[a_y, b_y]$ after shifting $a_x$ and$a_y$ to 0. 

Note that when expressed using the chain rule, both 
$\displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial a_x}$ and  $\displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial b_x}$
contain $\displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial b}$. As a result, 
$\displaystyle \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial a_x \partial b_x} $ leads to 
$\displaystyle \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial b^2} $. Although in the discussion below, 
for simplicity, we only illustrate the numerical differentiation on the first derivative, 
keep in mind that it is the second derivative that is more relevant in the calculation of 
 $\displaystyle \frac{\partial^4}{\partial a_x \partial b_x \partial a_y \partial b_y}
p(x, y, t) $. 

In the expression of finite difference solution above, 
$h^2 \mbox{F}_{reg}(b) $ is the regular part of 
the truncation error from discretizing the differential operator on the grid; 
$h^2 \mbox{F}_{irreg}(b) $ is the irregular part of the truncation error 
from the interpolations invoked by $\{x_0, y_0, x, y \}$ not being on grid points; 
and $\varepsilon_{mach} \mbox{F}_{round}(b) $ is the effect of round-off errors
with $\varepsilon_{mach} \sim 10^{-16}$ denoting the machine epsilon for 
IEEE double precision system. 
The coefficient, $\mbox{F}_{reg}(b) $, of the regular part of truncation error 
is a smooth function of $b$ with derivative $= O(1)$. 
The coefficient, $\mbox{F}_{round}(b) $, in the effect of round-off errors, 
behaves virtually like a random variable, discontinuous in $b$. 
For the irregular part of truncation error, the coefficient $\mbox{F}_{irreg}(b) $ 
in general is continuous in $b$ but not smooth in $b$ where the derivative has 
discontinuities of magnitude $O\left( \frac{1}{h} \right)$. 
For example, the error in 
a piece-wise linear interpolation of a smooth function at position $b$ using step $h$ 
has the general form of 
$$\mbox{Interpolation error } = O(h^2) (1-\mbox{rem}(b/h,1)) \mbox{rem}(b/h,1)$$ 
The coefficient part $\mbox{F}_{irreg}(b) = (1-\mbox{rem}(b/h,1)) \mbox{rem}(b/h,1) $ 
is continuous in $b$ but not differentiable. Its first derivative 
has the behavior of 
$$ \frac{\partial }{\partial b} \mbox{F}_{irreg}(b) =  \frac{1}{h} \left(1-2\mbox{rem}(b/h,1) \right)$$

Based on the expression we wrote out above for the finite difference solution, 
applying the numerical differentiation on t with step $\varepsilon$ yields: 
\begin{eqnarray}
& & \frac{p_{FD}(\left. x, y, t \right| b+\varepsilon)-p_{FD}(\left. x, y, t \right| b -\varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon} \nonumber \\
& & \hspace*{1cm} =  \frac{\partial }{\partial b} p(\left. x, y, t \right| b) + O(\varepsilon^2)
 + h^2 \frac{\mbox{F}_{reg}(b+\varepsilon)-\mbox{F}_{reg}(b-\varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon}  \nonumber \\
& & \hspace*{1cm} + h^2 \frac{\mbox{F}_{irreg}(b+\varepsilon)-\mbox{F}_{irreg}(b-\varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon}
 + \varepsilon_{mach} \frac{\mbox{F}_{round}(b+\varepsilon)-\mbox{F}_{round}(b-\varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon}  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
In the equation above, as the step in the numerical differentiation is refined, the first line 
of the RHS is well behaved, converging to the true value 
$\frac{\partial }{\partial b} p(\left. x, y, t \right| b)$ as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. 
The second line of RHS, however, is problematic. As $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, 
the contribution from round-off error blows up to infinity
$$ \varepsilon_{mach} \frac{\mbox{F}_{round}(b+\varepsilon)-\mbox{F}_{round}(b-\varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon}  = O\left(\frac{\varepsilon_{mach}}{\varepsilon} \right) 
\longrightarrow \infty \;\;\;\; \mbox{as } \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 $$
The contribution from the irregular part of truncation error is 
$$ h^2 \frac{\mbox{F}_{irreg}(b+\varepsilon)-\mbox{F}_{irreg}(b-\varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon}  = 
O\left(\frac{h^2}{\max(\varepsilon, h)} \right) $$ 
In the second order numerical differentiation, however, the contribution from 
the irregular part of truncation error behaves like 
$$ h^2 \frac{\mbox{F}_{irreg}(b+\varepsilon)-2\mbox{F}_{irreg}(b)
+\mbox{F}_{irreg}(b-\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon^2 }  = 
O\left(\frac{h^2}{\max(\varepsilon^2, h^2)} \right) $$
    \textcolor{red}{DONE}
